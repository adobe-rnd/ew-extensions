## Overview

This repository hosts **extensions** for the Experience Workspace (EW). Each extension is a self-contained [DA App SDK](https://docs.da.live/developers/guides/developing-apps-and-plugins) application deployed on its own AEM Edge Delivery Services site and loaded into the EW shell.

Extensions add capabilities to EW — editors, panels, tools, and integrations — without modifying the core platform.

## Extensions

| Extension | Path | Entry point | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Skills Editor** | `apps/skills/` | `tools/skills.html` | Manage skills, agents, MCP servers, prompts, and memory |

> More extensions coming soon.

## Architecture

Every extension follows the same pattern:

1. **Entry point** — an HTML page under `tools/` that imports the DA App SDK and bootstraps the extension.
2. **EW hosts the extension** via iframe at `da.live/app/{org}/{site}/tools/{name}`. The SDK handles authentication by passing the user's IMS token into the app.
3. **Extension component** — a LitElement (or vanilla JS module) that owns its own UI, state, and data operations against the DA Admin API.

## Local development

```bash
# Serve locally
cd ~/Projects/DA/da-skills
aem up

# Open any extension with local override
# https://da.live/app/{org}/{site}/tools/{extension}?ref=local
```

The `?ref=local` parameter tells EW to load from `http://localhost:3000` instead of the CDN.

## Adding an extension

1. Create a new directory under `apps/{your-extension}/`.
2. Add an entry point at `tools/{your-extension}.html` that imports the DA App SDK.
3. Implement your extension component — see `apps/skills/` for a reference implementation.
4. Update the extensions table above.

## Authentication

The DA App SDK handles authentication for all extensions. When EW loads an extension in an iframe, the SDK passes the user's IMS access token via PostMessage. Extensions call `initAuth(token)` to configure subsequent DA Admin API requests.

No separate login flow is needed — the user is already authenticated in EW.

## CI

Linting (ESLint + Stylelint) runs on every push that touches `apps/`. E2e tests (Playwright) are available locally — see `test/e2e/README.md` for the tiered test strategy.
